Vulnerable tag: simpleDDOs_vulnerable
patched tag: simpleDDOS_patched
This attack causes a denial of service to for any requests from the server
The malicious agent must send a 4 byte number to the server and nothing after it.
This happens because the server is waiting to receive a message the size of that four byte number. If no message is sent after the number,
then the server waits indefinitely.
To expose this attack I wrote a malicious client that doesn't even login, but simply connects and sends a number to the server.

To replicate: start server, run /attack/availability/simpleDDOS/DDOS.py

To solve this vulnerability, a timeout structure will be implemented so a request recieving no data is cut after a certain
amount of time.

POST-PATCH: The database is now organized into a file for each user, with a cap of 1000000 bytes for a users file.
a user can no longer slow down the server by continuously sending smsgs.

Media link - (optional) Is there some news worthy compromise that used a vulnerability similar to this?
